# Employee-Management-System

The code represents a Java servlet-based web application that interacts with a MySQL database for managing employee information.
It includes multiple servlets for different functionalities:

Register Servlet: Handles employee registration and file upload (resume).

Login Servlet: Validates employee login based on email and password.

Update Servlet: Updates employee details (e.g., department) using email.

Password Reset Servlet: Allows users to reset their password.

Profile Servlet: Retrieves and displays employee information from the database.

Show Servlet: Displays employee details based on employee ID.

Delete Servlet: Deletes an employee record based on email.

The application uses JDBC for database interaction and handles form data processing and navigation using servlets and JSPs. 

Each servlet handles specific operations like inserting, updating, deleting, and fetching employee records from the MySQL database.
